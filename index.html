				<h1>Is Music The Answer To Ending The Black Mental Health Crisis?</h1>

				<p>By Ashley Reed</p>

				<!-- Great ipsum texts: http://meettheipsums.com/ | this one is Sagan ipsum: http://saganipsum.com/ -->
				<p class="first-graph">While public conversations about mental health treatment in Black communities have become more prevalent in recent years, there are still stigmas and barriers preventing Black people from receiving mental health treatment.</p>

                 <p>Music has historically been used as a safe outlet for Black artists to express both their internal and external struggles while also providing a space for Black listeners to address their own, and some experts think continuing that tradition can help encourage Black people to seek mental health treatment. 
                </p>

				<iframe title="[Rates of Emergency Department visits for any mental health disorder]" aria-label="Bar chart" id="datawrapper-chart-rzd6f" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rzd6f/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="163" data-external="1"></iframe>

				<p>Earlier this year, the CDC released statistics From 2018 to 2020, which showed, rates of ED visits for any mental health disorder were highest among non-Hispanic Black adults. It  also showed Black adults had the highest rates of substance use disorders, anxiety-related disorders, mood disorders , and schizophrenia. 

Karthik Gunnia is a clinical psychologist and an Associate Professor at The New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, where he created and teaches an undergraduate course called “Mind Playing Tricks on Me: Mental Health in Contemporary Music.” The course is named after the 1991 rap song performed by the Geto boys, and explores how artists addressing mental health in their music can help to remove the stigma from mental health treatment. 

While he acknowledges that the stigmas surrounding healthcare in Black communities are “understandable”,  Gunnia believes the increase of Black popular music artists explicitly addressing their mental health struggles in their music, can help change opinions on mental health treatment. “You have these artists that are normalizing these things," he says. If someone like Kendrick can talk about being depressed, and he's on top of the world, he’s a success,  then It's easier for the random 17-year old to admit that they're feeling down. It starts conversations, it gives people language to put their feelings into words. I think all that can be really powerful.”
