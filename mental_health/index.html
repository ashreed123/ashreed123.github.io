				<h1>Is Music The Answer To Ending The Black Mental Health Crisis?</h1>

                                                                   </div>

				<p class="first-graph">I first spotted Allison Soul at an open Mic held in a secret loft in Bushwick. She wore a long warm brown sweater dress and black combat boots. Her locs were styled in a chic high ponytail and her smile was vibrant. Accompanied only by clapping of the audience, she began to sing, but her lyrics contradicted her jovial demeanor. 
                                                                               </p>

                 <p>“When you get to a certain age/ 
                     where being you just ain't enough filled with so much rage/ 
                      like a bird trapped in a cage/ 
                         I lost my way."
                                      </p>

                  <p>“It was a freestyle I created”, she says as we meet a year later at Central Park. I was thinking like, where did I start, how did I start doing this, what is my story?” </p>

                   
                   <p>Allison soul is a 27-year old independent artist and songwriter. Her music is a blend of R&B, Soul and Hip hop with lyrics that often broaches topics like anxiety, self-doubt, and depression. Topics that she says reflect not only her life experiences, but the experiences of many young Black women. “All of us go through times where we just don't feel like enough. Going through the emotions of feeling like a caged bird, because you don't know where to go. I channel that through my music frequently.”</p>

                  <p>Soul joins the spate of Black musical artists in the past few years who are opening up about their mental health struggles in and out of their music. From rappers Rod Wave and Monaleo rapping about their struggles with depression to R&B singers like Ari Lennox and Summer Walker candidly discussing their grapples with social anxiety on social media. One of the most recent and prominent musical figures  is hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, who recently released her newest single “Cobra. On the single, she repeatedly raps that she is depressed, and confessed to feeling intense suicidal thoughts.</p>


                 <p>Earlier this year, The CDC released statistics that shows, in the United States, Black adults had the highest rates of Emergency Department visits for any mental health disorder from 2018 to 2020. Dr. Dana E. Crawford, a pediatric and clinical psychologist based in Manhattan, believes that the increase in ED visits is due to lack of awareness and access to proper healthcare for Black people. “I would say the fact that this is showing up in the emergency department and not in other specialties also speaks to access to healthcare.”, she states. Because the ED is where people who are impoverished go for care, not for those who are thriving and have access.”<p>

			    <p>According to the NYC Mayor's office of Community Mental health, There is unequal access to mental healthcare in New York City. New Yorkers who are BlPOC New Yorkers are less likely to be connected to mental healthcare than White New Yorkers. Factors that contribute to this include experiences of discrimination or racism, material hardships and negative stigmas of mental health treatment. Dr. Crawford believes the strong black women and strong black man label is a significant contributor to the stigma. “I mean, there are so many reasons why going to a therapist would be off putting,” Crawford says. “I think the biggest is we are people of survivors and going to get help might imply someone might think that it means that you're not surviving, you're not strong enough.”</p>

			    <p>And though all musical genres can be important vessels for mental health awareness. Crawford believes the genre born out of New York, has the potential to be one of the most impactful. “When I think of hip hop mental health, it's specifically telling you about my mental health experience with a rhythm, with a flow that's going to vibrate through your body like a beat does," she says. “And that vibration is going to directly correlate to mental health, help you name things that maybe have been taboo or confusing, and you didn't have the language for it. Hip hop can often teach language.”</p>


			    <p>Music was helpful in Soul’s mental health journey, she wants listeners to know seeking treatment is also important and beneficial. “I think therapy is great because I think you can get a real sense of your mental well being, and what you need to work on," says Soul. Music can be great but if you are someone who needs extra help, don't be afraid to look for it.</p>

			    <p>Though Allison is not yet as famous as rap superstar Megan Thee Stallion she has gained a small fan base of predominantly Black young adults who have told her that they appreciate her music is relatable and real. “My audience is, of course, black people and black women and there's just this thing of being black that we kind of share this You know, unspoken bond," she says.“It's amazing. It makes me feel really good and it gives me more reasons to keep going, cause I know I'm not the only one going through this stuff.” And I do want to uplift people in a positive way. I also want to be real and I want to talk about things that people don't want to talk about, or feelings that people are afraid to express. I want to uncover that with my music.”</p>
